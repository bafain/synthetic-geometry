# Synthetic Geometry
So far, this formalization project is only about synthetic algebraic geometry.
A good place to start is [here](SyntheticGeometry/Spec.lagda.md).

# How to check/work on the code in this repo
In ```~/.agda/libraries``` there should be a line ```PATH/cubical.agda-lib```, where PATH is the path to the root of the clone of the cubical library you want to use.
